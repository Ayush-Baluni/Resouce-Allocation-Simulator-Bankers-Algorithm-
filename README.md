This is a simulation made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that demonstrates how deadlock prevention is applied using the Banker's Algorithm.
This simulation features:
    1. Adding resources with names and units
    2. Adding processes with max needs
    3. Requesting resources to allocate to individual processes
    4. Releasing resources from individual processes
    5. Finding safe process order
    6. Preventing deadlock situation
